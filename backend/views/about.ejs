      <h2>My Upbringing</h2>
      <p>
        My coding journey began back in 2008 when I was in 4th grade. I created my first website using the now defunct Freewebs, sparking curiosity that would later develop into a full passion.
        By high school, I was competing in web design competitions, and my work on a website for my school's "science bowl" event won me a trip with theCO to San Francisco to visit tech
        giants like Google and LinkedIn. That experience solidified my love for building and developing digital solutions.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Do Now</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Memphis. My studies and experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in web and software development.
        I've worked with languages like <strong>Python, Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS,</strong> and <strong>C++</strong>, building projects that span all aspects of development. One of my notable achievements is developing a GPA calculator
        that was adopted by the University of Memphis' international admissions program to streamline application evaluations.
